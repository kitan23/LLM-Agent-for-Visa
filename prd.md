# OPT-RAG: International Student Visa Assistant PRD

## Project Overview
OPT-RAG is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) LLM agent pipeline designed to help international students navigate visa-related issues, OPT applications, study/work authorization questions, and other related concerns. The system will provide accurate, context-aware responses by leveraging relevant documentation and resources.

## Target Users
- International students in the United States
- University advisors and administrators
- Immigration support staff
- Prospective international students

## Problem Statement
International students face complex visa regulations, application processes, and work authorization requirements that can be difficult to navigate. Accurate information is critical but often scattered across multiple sources, difficult to interpret, or not easily accessible when needed most.

## Project Goals
1. Create a reliable, accessible AI assistant for international student visa queries
2. Provide accurate information on OPT, CPT, visa status, work authorization, and related topics
3. Reduce time spent searching for information across multiple sources
4. Help prevent visa status issues through proactive information delivery
5. Create a platform that can be expanded to cover additional international student concerns

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Document Ingestion**: Upload and process official immigration documents, university policies, and government resources
- **Natural Language Query Interface**: Allow users to ask questions in plain language
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Provide answers specifically relevant to the user's situation
- **Source Citation**: Reference the specific documents or policies used to generate each answer
- **Conversation History**: Maintain context throughout a conversation session

### Technical Requirements
- **RAG Pipeline**: Implement retrieval-augmented generation to pull relevant context from documents
- **Local LLM Integration**: Support for running with local LLMs for privacy and control
- **Vector Database**: Store and efficiently retrieve document embeddings
- **API Gateway**: Manage request routing and load balancing
- **User Interface**: Clean, accessible frontend for interactions
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Track system performance and user interactions
- **Containerization**: Package components for easy deployment

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Accuracy**: Responses must be highly accurate given the critical nature of visa information
- **Response Time**: Fast enough for interactive use (target <5 seconds)
- **Scalability**: Support for multiple concurrent users
- **Privacy**: Secure handling of potentially sensitive user information
- **Availability**: High uptime for dependable service
- **Compliance**: Adhere to data protection regulations

## System Architecture
The system will follow a microservices architecture with the following components:

1. **Frontend Service**: Streamlit-based user interface
2. **Backend API**: FastAPI-based service handling requests and LLM orchestration
3. **Document Processing Pipeline**: Ingestion, chunking, embedding generation
4. **Vector Database**: Storage for document embeddings (FAISS)
5. **LLM Service**: Interface to local or hosted language models
6. **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger for observability
7. **API Gateway**: NGINX for routing and load balancing
8. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment

## Data Sources
- USCIS official documentation
- Department of State visa information
- University-specific international student policies
- I-20, DS-2019, and other visa document examples
- OPT/CPT guidelines and application instructions
- Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) resources

## Deployment Strategy
1. **Local Development**: Docker Compose for local testing
2. **Containerization**: Docker images for all components
3. **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for deployment and scaling
4. **Cloud Deployment**: Support for deployment on cloud platforms

## Success Metrics
- User satisfaction ratings
- Query resolution rate
- Response accuracy (validated against official sources)
- System performance metrics (response time, uptime)
- User retention and engagement

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: MVP Development
- Basic RAG pipeline implementation
- Document ingestion for core visa documents
- Simple query interface
- Local deployment capability

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- Improved context handling
- More comprehensive document corpus
- Personalization based on user profile
- Enhanced UI with additional features

### Phase 3: Production Deployment
- Full monitoring and observability
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Cloud deployment
- Performance optimization

## Future Expansion
- Multi-language support
- Integration with university systems
- Notification system for visa deadline reminders
- Mobile application interface
- API for third-party integrations

## Limitations and Constraints
- The system provides information only; it cannot replace legal advice
- Responses are based on available documents and may not cover all edge cases
- Immigration policies change frequently, requiring regular corpus updates
- LLM responses need human verification for critical decisions

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Incorrect information leading to visa issues
  - **Mitigation**: Clear disclaimers, source citations, regular verification

- **Risk**: Data privacy concerns
  - **Mitigation**: Local LLM deployment, secure data handling, minimal data collection

- **Risk**: System unavailability during critical periods
  - **Mitigation**: Robust infrastructure, monitoring, and failover systems

- **Risk**: Hallucination or fabrication by the LLM
  - **Mitigation**: Strict RAG implementation, response verification mechanisms
